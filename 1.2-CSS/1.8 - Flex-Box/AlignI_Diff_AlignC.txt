`align-items` and `align-content` are both CSS properties used in the context of flexbox or grid layouts to control the alignment of items within a container. Let's break down the differences with simple examples:

`align-items`:


- **Applies to:** Flex containers.
- **Controls:** Alignment of flex items along the cross-axis (vertical axis for a row layout, horizontal axis for a column layout).
- **Values:** `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, `stretch`.
Example:
css
  .container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center; /* Align items at the center of the cross-axis */
  }



`align-content`:


- **Applies to:** Flex containers with multiple lines (when `flex-wrap: wrap` is used).
- **Controls:** Alignment of lines within the flex container along the cross-axis.
- **Values:** `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `stretch`.
- **Example:**
  ```css
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allow items to wrap onto new lines */
    align-content: space-between; /* Spread lines evenly along the cross-axis with space between them */
  }
  ```
Summary:
- `align-items` works on the individual items inside the container, aligning them along the cross-axis.
- `align-content` works on the entire lines within the container when there are multiple lines due to wrapping, aligning them along the cross-axis.

Remember, these properties are most commonly used in flexbox layouts, but they can also be used in grid layouts with similar functionality.
