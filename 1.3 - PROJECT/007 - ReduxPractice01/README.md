# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To efficiently run the project after cloning or downloading it, follow these steps:

1. **Check Node Installation**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your PC or laptop.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   ðŸš€ This command will build the project and start the development server. You can access the project in your web browser at the specified URL, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

By following these steps, you can efficiently set up and run the project on your local machine. ðŸŽ‰
